All files related to surgeries are available in the repository [Surgeries_3D](https://github.com/FreelyMovingSetup/Surgeries_3D).  
This includes parts related to windows (contour, pointing, drawing, and pushers to keep windows in place) as well as flexible "chambers" for intrinsic imaging.
Some files related to surgeries more specific to the S1 implant are available in the folder below.

All files related to the implant are available in the repository [Implant_3D](https://github.com/FreelyMovingSetup/Implant_3D).
This includes head fixation stuff, files sent for production of metal parts at Sculpteo, mouse (body, stull, atlases, brain), and parts of the implant per se (implant, hats, nuts & rings & models of both tips of the fiber-bundle). Some parts relative to staining, trackers and imu boards are available)

Similarly, all 3D parts related to the Morj are located in [Morj_3D](https://github.com/FreelyMovingSetup/Morj_3D) and files relative to Maze 3D models are in [Maze_3D](https://github.com/FreelyMovingSetup/Maze_3D).
